    The greenhouse monitoring system for techy gardeners.
</p>

## What is Verdant?
Verdant is a greenhouse monitoring system that uses a range of sensors to give gardeners an insight into the conditions their plants are growing in.

## How will it work?
The plan is for the system to consist of 3 modules:
- Base Station
    - All modules will connect wirelessly to this.
    - The base station will be responsible for processing and uploading all data to a database.
- Climate Monitor
    - This will be placed in the greenhouse to monitor variables of the environment, such as temperature and humidity.
- Soil Monitor
    - This will have multiple soil moisture sensors connected to it and collect soil moisture data.
    - A single Verdant system will be capable of having multiple soil monitor hubs connected.

## Development
Verdant is still in _early_ development. You can follow along with the progress [here](JOURNAL.md)!
